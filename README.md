# Debian Update Notifier
Update Notifier is a simple and easy-to-use application that uses chronjobs for scheduling package updates. It pipes a password stored in memory to sudo subprocesses and stores no passwords in any plain text files.

## Requirements
PySide2, trio, sudo, and cron

``$ pip3 install PySide2 trio``

``$ apt install sudo cron``

## Debian Cron Addition
`` $ sudo ./CronInstall.sh [n]``

This is not a package installation. It appends a cronjob to the /etc/anacrontab file using the path to the update.py file in the current directory. It Sets the chronjob to run the update.py script at the current location every n days. The default is 30 if nothing is specified. anacrontab can be modified manually on different distros. The update script can also be run manually.

## TODO
* Handle subprocess termination after cancel button is pressed
* Handle ctrl-c terminal press
* Handle Cancel and other errors
* Add chronjob install script âœ“
* Add icon
